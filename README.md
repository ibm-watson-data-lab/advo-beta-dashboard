**Don't have an IBM Cloud account?** If you haven't already, you'll be prompted to sign up for an IBM Cloud account when you click the button.  Sign up, verify your email address, then return here and click the the **Deploy to IBM Cloud** button again. Your new credentials let you deploy to the platform and also to code online with IBM Cloud and Git. If you have questions about working in IBM Cloud, find answers in the [IBM Cloud Docs](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/).

Or you could manually deploy from the command-line.

Manual deployment to IBM Cloud requires `git` and the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/advo-beta-dashboard.git
$ cd advo-beta-dashboard
$ cf push
```
